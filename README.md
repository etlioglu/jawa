# jawas

A Nextflow pipeline extracting results from Nextflow runs. Currently supports nfcore/rnaseq and nf-core/differentialbundance.

## nf-core/rnaseq

- Length scaled gene counts

## nf-core/differentialbundance

- normalized counts
- variance stabilized counts
- differential abundance results
- report

All of the tables above are annotated so as to include gene symbols.
